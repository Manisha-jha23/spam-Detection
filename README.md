# 📧 Spam Detection Project

A machine learning project that uses Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam messages from SMS data.

🌐 **Live Demo:** [Visit Website](https://spam-detection-website.streamlit.app/) | [GitHub Pages](https://Manisha-jha23.github.io/spam-detection)

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive User Input** - Type messages and check if they're spam
- **Web Interface** - Beautiful Streamlit UI for easy use
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Naive Bayes classification
- Accuracy metrics and performance evaluation

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spam-detection.git
cd spam-detection
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset. Make sure the `spam.csv` file is in the project directory.

## ▶️ Usage

### Option 1: Interactive Terminal Version
Run the terminal version (interactive input):
```bash
python spam_detection.py
```
Then type messages when prompted. Type 'quit' to exit.

### Option 2: Web Interface (Recommended! 🎨)
Run the beautiful web interface:
```bash
streamlit run spam_detection_web.py
```
Your browser will open with the interactive UI!
